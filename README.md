# PHYEX-fortran-tool

This set of tools is primarily designed to be applied on the [PHYEX](https://github.com/UMR-CNRM/PHYEX)
repository. But they are normally generic enough to be used in other contexts.

The tools can be used with on the command line (the pft.py utility can be found in the bin directory)
or as a python package (pypft directory). The documentation is in the doc directory and some examples
are in the examples directory.
